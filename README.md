### Introduction ðŸš€
Hello! I'm Vugar Safarzada. My journey into web development began at the age of 16, and I've been passionately crafting digital solutions ever since.

### Projects ðŸ’»
While I predominantly utilize GitHub for versioning and syncing my projects, I've also embarked on several personal open-source ventures. Here are a few that I'm particularly proud of:

- **[Pexty](https://github.com/vugarsafarzada/php_framework)**: A bespoke PHP framework I created from scratch.
- **[Personal Portfolio](https://github.com/vugarsafarzada/vugarsafarzada.repo)**: A digital space showcasing my work and experiences.
- **[Twitter Clone](https://github.com/vugarsafarzada/twitter-clone)**: A replication of Twitter, built harnessing the power of Vue.js, Vuex, Node.js, and Express.js.
- **[Task Management](https://github.com/vugarsafarzada/task-management)**: A comprehensive TODO app featuring tags and filter capabilities.
- **[AL-VER](https://github.com/vugarsafarzada/Al-Ver)**: An e-commerce platform developed using React, Node.js, and Express.js.
- **[Drone Model](https://github.com/vugarsafarzada/Drone-Project)**: A visual drone model designed purely with HTML, CSS, and JS.
- **[CapsLock](https://github.com/vugarsafarzada/CapsLock)**: A PC store application fortified with HTML, CSS, Node.js, Express.js, MongoDB, and Mongoose.
